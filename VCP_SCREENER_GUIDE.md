# 🎯 VCP Screener - Complete Guide

## What is VCP (Volatility Contraction Pattern)?

VCP is a powerful trading pattern that represents **base building** before explosive breakouts:

- **V** = Volatility (gets squeezed)
- **C** = Contraction (lower highs & lows)
- **P** = Pattern (predicts breakout)

---

## 🎯 Sniper Entry (VCP + Dry Up)

### Definition
Perfect combination for **premium entry points**:
1. **VCP Base** - Stock consolidating near highs with low volatility
2. **Dry Up** - Support test with extremely low volume
3. **Score:** 90-95 (Highest confidence)

### What It Looks Like
```
Price near 52-week high ↑
↓
Narrow range (low volatility) ←→
↓
Support test with low volume
= READY FOR EXPLOSIVE MOVE! 🚀
```

### How to Trade It
1. **Setup:** Wait for both VCP + Dry Up conditions
2. **Entry:** Buy next bullish candle after dry up
3. **Stop:** Below the dry up low
4. **Target:** Previous resistance or higher
5. **Reward/Risk:** Usually 3:1 or better

### Example
```
Stock XYZ:
- Price: Rp 5,000 (near high)
- 5-day avg volume: 100M
- Current volume: 20M (Dry Up!)
- Spread: Low
= 🎯 SNIPER ENTRY READY
```
