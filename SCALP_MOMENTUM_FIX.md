# 🚀 Scalp Screener - MOMENTUM FOCUSED (Fixed!)

## ✅ What Was Wrong

**Before:** Screener was finding stocks that were **consolidating/accumulating** but not moving anywhere.
- ❌ Low volume (< 70%) = Stocks not doing anything
- ❌ Near MA20 support = Stocks just sitting there
- ❌ No momentum requirement = Dead stocks showing up
- ❌ Result: "Signals" that don't go anywhere

**The Problem:** You're right - for **SCALPING**, we need to catch **MOMENTUM**, not consolidation!

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **NEW DETECTION LOGIC - MOMENTUM FOCUSED** ⚡

#### **SCALP SNIPER (Best Entry)** 🎯
**What it catches:** Stocks just starting to move with momentum

**Criteria:**
- ✅ **Early Momentum:** 0.5% to 3% (starting to move, not dead!)
- ✅ **Volume Confirmation:** 1.2x to 3x average (interest building)
- ✅ **Price Above MA20:** In uptrend
- ✅ **Momentum Accelerating:** Recent 3 candles > Previous 3 candles
- ✅ **Volume Increasing:** Recent 3 candles volume > Previous 3
- ✅ **Buying Pressure:** More buying than selling
- ✅ **Price Strength:** Candle Power >= 70

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Catches stocks JUST starting to move (0.5-3%)
- ✅ Volume confirms interest (1.2-3x)
- ✅ Momentum is accelerating (not flat)
- ✅ Perfect for scalping (1-3% quick gains)

**Example:**
```
Stock: BBCA
Momentum: +1.8% (starting to move!) ✅
Volume: 2.1x average (interest building) ✅
Trend: Above MA20 (uptrend) ✅
Signal: ⚡ SCALP SNIPER
Action: ENTER NOW! Stock about to accelerate
Target: 2-3% gain in 15-30 minutes
```

---

#### **SCALP BREAKOUT (Fast Trade)** 🚀
**What it catches:** Stocks already breaking out with strong momentum

**Criteria:**
- ✅ **Strong Momentum:** > 2% (already moving!)
- ✅ **High Volume:** > 2.5x average (big interest)
- ✅ **Green Candle:** Buying in control
- ✅ **Strong Power:** Candle Power > 75
- ✅ **Price Above MA20:** Uptrend confirmed
- ✅ **Close Near High:** Close position > 60%

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Strong momentum already present
- ✅ High volume confirms breakout
- ✅ Quick 1-2% scalps
- ✅ Fast entry/exit

**Example:**
```
Stock: BBRI
Momentum: +3.2% (breaking out!) ✅
Volume: 3.8x average (huge interest) ✅
Candle: Green, closes near high ✅
Signal: 🚀 SCALP BREAKOUT
Action: Jump in! Already moving
Target: Quick 1-2% scalp
```

---

#### **VOLUME SPIKE (Major Interest)** 📢
**What it catches:** Sudden massive volume with positive price

**Criteria:**
- ✅ **Extreme Volume:** > 3x average (unusual activity!)
- ✅ **Positive Momentum:** > 0% (moving up)
- ✅ **Green Candle:** Buyers active
- ✅ **Price Above MA20:** Uptrend

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Unusual activity = something happening
- ✅ Often precedes big moves
- ✅ Investigate immediately

**Example:**
```
Stock: GOTO
Volume: 4.5x average (HUGE spike!) ✅
Momentum: +1.2% (positive) ✅
Signal: 📢 VOLUME SPIKE
Action: Investigate! Major news/interest
Target: Could be big move coming
```

---

#### **MOMENTUM BUILDING (Watch)** 👀
**What it catches:** Stocks showing early momentum signs

**Criteria:**
- ✅ **Building Momentum:** 0.3% to 2.5%
- ✅ **Volume Above Average:** > 1.0x
- ✅ **Price Above MA20:** Uptrend
- ✅ **Decent Power:** > 65
- ✅ **Accelerating:** Momentum or volume increasing

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Early warning system
- ✅ Watch for SNIPER or BREAKOUT signal
- ✅ Prepare for entry

**Example:**
```
Stock: TLKM
Momentum: +0.8% (building) ✅
Volume: 1.5x average (increasing) ✅
Signal: 👀 MOMENTUM BUILDING
Action: WATCH - May become SNIPER soon
Target: Wait for acceleration
```

### **Before (Wrong Approach):**
```
Looking for: Consolidation & Accumulation

```

### **After (Momentum Focused):**
```
Looking for: Early Momentum & Acceleration

- Momentum 0.5% to 3% (POSITIVE only) ✅
- Momentum ACCELERATING ✅
- Volume INCREASING ✅
- Result: Stocks starting to MOVE! ✅
```

## 🎯 Final Notes

**Key Insight:**
For scalping, you need to catch stocks that are **STARTING TO MOVE**, not stocks that are **SITTING STILL**.

**Old Logic:**
- Low volume = "Accumulation" ❌
- Near MA20 = "Support" ❌
- Result = Stocks not moving ❌

**New Logic:**
- Early momentum 0.5-3% = "Starting!" ✅
- Volume 1.2-3x = "Interest!" ✅
- Accelerating = "Going!" ✅
- Result = Stocks MOVING! ✅

**Now it works for SCALPING!** 🚀
