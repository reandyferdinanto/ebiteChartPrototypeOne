# 🚀 Scalp Screener - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Implemented

A fully functional **intraday scalping screener** that scans 25 Indonesian stocks on **5m and 15m timeframes** to find sniper entry opportunities BEFORE markup.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Detection Algorithm**

The screener uses the **exact same algorithm** as the chart, ensuring 100% matching signals:

#### **⚡ SCALP SNIPER Entry** (BEST for scalping)
**Conditions:**
- ✅ Price at/near MA20 (within 1.5%)
- ✅ Tail touches MA20, closes above
- ✅ Low volume (< 70% avg) = Dry up/Accumulation
- ✅ Momentum building (-1% to +3%) = Not explosive yet
- ✅ Strong accumulation (buying > selling)
- ✅ High candle power (85+)

**Why it works:**
- Catches stock RIGHT BEFORE markup
- Lowest risk entry (stop below MA20)
- Best risk/reward ratio (1:2 to 1:5)

#### **🚀 SCALP BREAKOUT Entry** (Fast trades)
**Conditions:**
- ✅ High volume (> 2.5x avg)
- ✅ Green candle with momentum
- ✅ Candle power > 75
- ✅ Price above MA20

**Why it works:**
- Momentum already started
- Quick 1-2% scalps
- Fast entry/exit

#### **👀 WATCH** (Monitor)
**Conditions:**
- ✅ Candle power > 70
- ✅ Price above MA20
- ✅ Momentum > -2%

**Why it works:**
- Setup forming
- Wait for confirmation
- Could become SNIPER or BREAKOUT

## 🎓 Signal Interpretation

### **Momentum**
```
+3% to +5%  → Very strong, but may be late
+1% to +3%  → IDEAL for sniper entry ⭐

-2% to -1%  → Weak, avoid unless great power
Below -2%   → Skip, downtrend
```

```
95-100 → Extreme (rare but amazing) ⭐⭐⭐
85-94  → Strong (sniper entries) ⭐⭐
75-84  → Good (valid but less ideal) ⭐
70-74  → Watch (needs confirmation)
Below 70 → Skip
```

### **Volume Ratio**
```
< 0.5x  → Extreme dry up (very bullish) ⭐⭐⭐
0.5-0.7x → Dry up (sniper setup) ⭐⭐
0.7-1.0x → Normal (neutral)
1.0-2.0x → Above average (building)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Trade every signal** → Be selective, quality > quantity
2. **Ignore the chart** → Always confirm visually
3. **Skip the stop loss** → ALWAYS use stops
4. **Hold too long** → Scalping = quick in/out
5. **Trade during low volume hours** → 9:00-11:00 AM and 1:30-3:30 PM best
6. **Revenge trade** → If stop hit, move on
7. **Overtrade** → Max 4-5 trades per day

### ✅ DO:
1. **Wait for SNIPER signals** → Best risk/reward
2. **Confirm on chart** → Check for ⚡ marker
3. **Use proper position sizing** → Max 2-3% risk per trade
4. **Take profits at targets** → Don't be greedy
5. **Exit at stop loss** → No hoping/praying
6. **Trade during active hours** → 9:00-11:00 AM, 1:30-3:00 PM
7. **Keep a trade journal** → Learn from wins/losses
