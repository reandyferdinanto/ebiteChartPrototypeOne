## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: I don't see colored dots on the chart**

**Solution 1: Enable Candle Power**
- Click the **"🔥 Candle Power"** button in Quick Modes
- Make sure it's highlighted/active

**Solution 2: Check Data Loading**
- Ensure the chart has loaded completely
- Look for "Loading..." message to disappear
- If stuck, refresh the page

**Solution 3: Check Last Candles**
- Candle power appears on the **last 50 candles** by default
- **Last 3 candles** always show scores
- Zoom out if you're zoomed in too much

**Solution 4: Scroll to Recent Data**
- Click **"📐 Fit"** button to fit all data
- Click **"📊 50D"** button to show last 50 days
- Candle power is most relevant for recent candles

### **Problem: Score seems wrong**

**Check these factors:**
1. **Volume Context**: Is volume high or low relative to 20-day average?
2. **MA Position**: Is price testing MA20 support?
3. **Candle Shape**: Does it have a lower wick (hammer/doji)?
4. **Buy/Sell Pressure**: Check if buying volume > selling volume

**Remember:** A red candle can have high score (90+) if:
- Low volume test at MA20 = NO SUPPLY
- Long lower wick = rejection of lower prices
- Buying pressure still present = demand > supply

### **Problem: Trading Signals panel not showing**

**Solution:**
- The panel appears automatically when you enable any indicator
- If hidden, it might be scrolled out of view
- The panel is "sticky" at the top, but below the controls
- Try clicking "🔥 Candle Power" button to trigger the display

## 💡 **PRACTICAL TIPS**

### **Tip 1: Focus on Recent Candles**
- The **last 3 candles** always show power scores
- Most relevant for current market condition
- Use **"📊 50D"** button to see recent 50 days clearly

### **Tip 2: Look for Score Progression**
```
Example of bullish progression:
Day 1: 65 (🎯 Support Test)
Day 2: 82 (🎯 TEST Support)
Day 3: 96 (🏛️ NO SUPPLY)
Day 4: 95 (🚀 VCP BREAKOUT)

Interpretation: Accumulation → Test → Confirmation → Breakout
Action: Enter on Day 3-4
```

### **Tip 3: Cross-Reference with Signals**
Always check both:
- **Candle Power Score** (the number in the dot)
- **Trading Signals Text** (below Quick Modes)

Example:
```
Chart shows: 96 (green dot)
Signal says: "🏛️ Wyckoff NO SUPPLY (Phase C)"
Confirmation: ✅ Both agree = high confidence
```

### **Tip 4: Understand Context**
Same score can mean different things:
- **90 at MA20 support** = Buy signal (NO SUPPLY test)
- **90 at resistance** = May face selling (top forming)
- **90 in uptrend** = Continuation (markup phase)
- **90 in downtrend** = Reversal attempt (accumulation starting)

### **Tip 5: Use Mobile-Friendly Features**
On mobile:
- **Pinch to zoom** on chart
- **Quick Modes** buttons are touch-friendly
- **Trading Signals** panel is sticky at top
- **Scores are visible** even on small screens

## ❓ **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

### **Q: Why is the last candle showing a different score than expected?**
A: The score is calculated based on:
- Current volume vs 20-day average
- Current spread vs average spread
- Buy/sell pressure over last 10 candles
- Position relative to MA20/MA50
- Wyckoff phase context

A red candle CAN have score 90+ if it's a low-volume test at support.

### **Q: Should I enter every 90+ score?**
A: Focus on these 90+ patterns:
- ✅ VCP + NO SUPPLY (98) - highest probability
- ✅ NO SUPPLY (96) - at MA20 support
- ✅ VCP BREAKOUT (95) - from tight base
- ✅ SPRING (93) - after shake-out

Avoid 90+ if it's:
- ❌ At major resistance
- ❌ After extended run (buying climax?)
- ❌ Without confirmation from other indicators

### **Q: How often does the score update?**
A: The score updates:
- Every time you load/refresh the page
- Every time new data is fetched
- Real-time if connected to live data feed

For daily trading: Check once after market close for final score.

### **Q: Can I use this for intraday trading?**
A: Yes, but:
- Daily (1D) timeframe is most accurate
- Wyckoff works best on daily charts
- For intraday: Use 15m or 1H charts, but lower confidence

### **Q: What if screener and chart show different signals?**
A: This shouldn't happen after the latest fix. If it does:
1. Refresh the page
2. Click "View" again from screener
3. Both should now align
4. If still different: The chart is more accurate (uses latest data)
